This project is a basic prototype of a doctor-patient healthcare platform. Currently, only some unstructured UI code has been written to visualize the layout. No backend, database, or functionality has been integrated due to time limitations. The code is not organized or complete and serves only as a design draft. Planned features include appointment booking, separate dashboards, medicine tracking, AI chatbot, billing, and X-ray analysis. This version is non-functional and meant for initial reference only. Future updates will focus on proper structuring, full integration, and feature development.
